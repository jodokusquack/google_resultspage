# google-homepage

In this project I will try to build a Google Results page. It should just look like the results-page, but doesn't have to do work the same way. (Considering links and the search bar).

This is an exercise from The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
